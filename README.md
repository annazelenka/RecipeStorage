## Overview
### Description
A mobile Android app developed in Java. Users can create profiles and store recipes. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Food & Drink
- **Mobile:** Only available on mobile
- **Story:** Store links or descriptions of recipes youâ€™ve liked along with pictures about how they turned out and notes about how to improve the recipe next time.
- **Market:** People who like to cook (especially using recipes from the Internet, not from physical books) and want to organize their recipes
- **Habit:** After cooking or baking something from a recipe, users record the recipe in the app.
- **Scope:** Use camera feature to take pictures, incorporate an SDK somehow
